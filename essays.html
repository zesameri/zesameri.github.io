              What does it mean to be of a place? Inspired by John Updike's A&P,
              R.E.M.'s Nightswimming and Heidegger's Being & Time.

        <dt> Investigating Bauermeister's Rainbow </dt>
        <dd class="list__item">
            <p>
              Although Rainbow creates a relationship between the human experience,
              the cellular and celestale, it does not project Bauermeister’s own
              spirituality and experience. Rainbow is valuable in that it is made
              shortly after her artistic voice in the Fluxus movement and the start
              of her lense boxes. It culminates her use of art as a way to change
              our perception of reality, and deviate from absolute truth, adding
              humanity to her intellectualization of her mother’s illness.

              I’m not convinced that time is linear. Occasionally I daydream in class.
              A day passes by as the professor changes slides. My mind often drifts to
              memories or make-believe moments of people who exist only in the past.
              When they drift out of my existence, they stick to my thoughts vividly
              for months or longer. Those strangers we meet can feel familial after
              an initial conversation. Although it is against my logic, they strike
              through me metaphysically. I’m coming to think that the way we perceive
              time is based solely on what we choose to remember...

        <dt> Subjectivity in the Work of Ellsworth Kelly. </dt>
        <dd class="list__item">
            <p>
              After four years of studying Kelly's <i>Green Curve with Radius Twenty Feet</i>,
              I began analyzing my subjective perspective on the painting. It came to represent
              my college experience. In this work I explored how a word represents a consented
              contextual/societal meaning through experience. How does a word substitute an idea?

            Meals remind me of movies. I like meals. Meals with company. Meals without company are so so.
            We make the food or the food is made for us. And we sit down, with plate in front of us.
            And we feel a sense of purpose. Hunger is innate, routine, and this meal wasn’t wrong
            in a way like snacking is. The meal is a part of our day that we attend to. It is a piece of time.
             It is shared in each family household, like Rockwell’s Thanksgiving. Movies are like meals.
             We sit down to eat them. We are hungry, well what are we hungry for?
