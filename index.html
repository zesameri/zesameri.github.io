    <p class="bio">
        This once was a professional site, made with little passion or purpose.
        I still am a software developer, nevertheless I've never enjoyed self promotion or praise.
        I'm no one special, I'm no one unique, still I felt intrigued to express a piece of me
        to the abyss of the Internet. Thank you for giving this place your time, and know that this is not a platform or a showcase, it is my
        workspace.

              There is a glass that separates me from you. <br>
              I can't tell if its visable, if its clear or opaque
          </p>
          <p>
              There is a glass that separates me from you. <br>
              I think you can see it. I think you know its there. <br>
              Stares. staring at me. <br>
              Or are they staring at the glass.
          </p>
          <p>
              If they looked away, did they look away from the transparent barrier. <br>
              Did they look away from me.
          </p>
          <p>
              There's a glass that separates me from you. <br>
              Its stiff. Its thick. Its cold. Like classroom lighting. <br>
              Its enclosing. Its plastic wrap. And I <br>
              don't have enough air to breathe.

                I’m not convinced that time is linear. Occasionally I daydream in class. A day passes by as the professor changes slides. My mind often drifts to memories or make-believe moments of people who exist only in the past. When they drift out of my existence, they stick to my thoughts vividly for months or longer. Those strangers we meet can feel familial after an initial conversation. Although it is against my logic, they strike through me metaphysically. I’m coming to think that the way we perceive time is based solely on what we choose to remember...
