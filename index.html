        This once was a professional site, made with little passion or purpose.
        I still am a software developer, nevertheless I've never enjoyed self promotion or praise.
        I'm no one special, I'm no one unique, still I felt intrigued to express a piece of me
        to the abyss of the Internet. Thank you for giving this place your time, and know that this is not a platform or a showcase, it is my
        workspace.

             This essay is written in a laissez faire style. Partially because
             I’m allowing myself to be stupid. What’s being smart if you never
             had a chance to be stupid. Also because I am (with a french accent)
             lazy.

              There is a glass that separates me from you. <br>
              I can't tell if its visable, if its clear or opaque
          </p>
          <p>
              There is a glass that separates me from you. <br>
              I think you can see it. I think you know its there. <br>
              Stares. staring at me. <br>
              Or are they staring at the glass.
          </p>

              If they looked away, did they look away from the divide. <br>
              Did they look away from me.
          </p>
          <p>
              There's a glass that separates me from you. <br>
              Its stiff. Its thick. Its cold. Like classroom lighting. <br>
              Its enclosing. Its plastic wrap. And I <br>
              don't have enough air to breathe.

              I’m not convinced that time is linear. Occasionally I daydream in class.
              A day passes by as the professor changes slides. My mind often drifts to
              memories or make-believe moments of people who exist only in the past.
              When they drift out of my existence, they stick to my thoughts vividly
              for months or longer. Those strangers we meet can feel familial after
              an initial conversation. Although it is against my logic, they strike
              through me metaphysically. I’m coming to think that the way we perceive
              time is based solely on what we choose to remember...

            Meals remind me of movies. I like meals. Meals with company. Meals without company are so so.
            We make the food or the food is made for us. And we sit down, with plate in front of us.
            And we feel a sense of purpose. Hunger is innate, routine, and this meal wasn’t wrong
            in a way like snacking is. The meal is a part of our day that we attend to. It is a piece of time.
             It is shared in each family household, like Rockwell’s Thanksgiving. Movies are like meals.
             We sit down to eat them. We are hungry, well what are we hungry for?
